Vexport
=======

Vexport is a tool for Actionscript 3 that converts a Vector based DisplayObject to an XML format.

It also can take that same XML format and re-create a Vector based DisplayObject.

Desktop Application - Coming Soon.
Will be able to load a swf file, you can then select all the valid DisplayObjects to convert to a compressed data file.
Which can then be loaded using the Vexport.swc
